\section{Softare Quality}
Lecture 4
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quality and price are two things.
    \item User Satisfaction = The Important Qualities are High $+$ Within Budget
    \item External qualities are visible to the user p7
    \item Internal qualities are visible to the developer
    \item Product qualities and Process qualities, p7
    \item Correctness: if it satisfies its requirements specification. p9
    \item Reliability: The software works most time, but fails in a small portion of time. p10
    \item Robustness: if it behaves reasonably even in unanticipated or exceptional situations. p11
    \item Performance(efficiency): related to external quality requirements for speed and storage. p15
    \item Usability: how easy a user can use the product. p16
    \item Verifiability: how easy it is to convince someone it is correct. p18
    \item Maintainability: how ease it is to modify after its initial release. p19
    \item Reusability: is reusable if it can be used to create a new product. p22
    \item Portability: if it can run in different environments. p23
    \item Understandability: how easy it is to understand requirements, design, implementation, and documentation. p24
    \item Interoperability, Productivity, Timeliness and Visibility: p30$-$33
\end{itemize}

\section{Softare Principles}
Lecture 5 (L5)
Lecture 6 (L6)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rigour: An argument is valid if the conclusion is logical,and it has mathematics support. Use between human.
    \item Formality: A language with a formal syntax and a precise semantics. Use between machines. 
    Advantages: formality can look at all possible outcomes, and this can help to find anything is missed by written specs.
    Disadvantages: it takes a long time to learn it. The tools are not easy to use, and they are not complete. p12
    \item Separation of concerns: different concerns should be isolated and considered separately, 
    reduce a complex problem to a set of simpler problems, parallelization of effort. p18
    \item Modularity: is a complex system that is divided into smaller parts called modules. It enables separation of concerns
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different parts of the system are considered separately
        \item The parts of the system are considered separately from their composition
        \item Good module design L6.P4
        \begin{itemize}
            \item High cohesion: The components of the module are closely related. p24
            \item Low coupling: The module does not strongly depend on other modules. low is good, but not zero coupling.
        \end{itemize}
        \item this allow modules be treated in two way:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item As a set of interchangeable parts
            \item As individuals
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Abstraction: is the process of focusing on what is important while ignoring what is irrelevant. Special case of 
    separation of concerns. L6.P6
    \item Make an Abstract Data Type Abstract: donâ€™t say how it implemented, gave interface but not the implementation.
    \item Anticipation of change: is the principle that future change should be anticipated and planned for.
    Some technique to deal with change. L6.P10
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Configuration management
        \item Information hiding
        \item Documentation
    \end{itemize}
    \item Generality: is to use a more general solution to solve the problem. L6.P13
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Good1: increase reusability.
        \item Good2: general problem is easier to solve somtimes
        \item Bad1: less efficient
        \item Bad2: it is costly to have a general solution
        \item Use more abstraction, usually help increase generality.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Incrementality: solving problems by producing successively closer approximations to a solution. Get feedback, 
    and improve it accordingly.
\end{itemize}

\section{Module}
Lecture 7
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design for change: algorithm, safety standard. p5
    \item Product families: cars, phones
    \item Components of a module: a interface and a implementation(hide change in implementation). p13
    \item Information hiding: hidden from clients. Anticipating changes need to have information hiding. p16
    \item Example of Module p17
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Record: only have data
        \item Collection of related procedures(library): have behavior not state
        \item Abstract object: only have one instance
        \item Abstract data type: collection of abstract objects
        \item Generic modules: abstract description for a family of objects, like generic module of stack of integers, 
        strings, stacks.
    \end{itemize}

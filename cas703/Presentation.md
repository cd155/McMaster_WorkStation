1. Summarize the paper: 
    - what is the topic/contribution,
        - information hiding
        - modularization
    - what was important about it
        - The paper describe what is benefit of modularization, and giving examples to illustrate how the modularization effect to the software qualities.

    - how was the idea/contribution evaluated (if at all)?
        - Modularization is heavily related to separate corncens, documentation, maintainbility. These become the key software fundmentals.
2. Assess the impact of the paper on the field: 
    - why was the paper influential?
        - add likely change at the stage.
    - Did it lead to the development of a special tool/technique? 
        - the way to write MIS(Module Interface Specification), we list what is likly change
        - Parnar mentioned flowchart was a useful abstraction for systems, but he think it should include additional information. UML provide more information.
    - Did it change the way we think about the theory of software design?

3. What limitations or weaknesses did you identify about the paper?
    - You can be critical, but be fair: some of these papers are quite old and you have the benefit of hindsight! For example, a criticism like “We wouldn’t do it this way today” is not particularly insightful. But a criticism like “I think this technique overlooked this other important method or idea, meaning that there were ways to be even more efficient...” 
    - hierarchical structure mentioned in the paper is related to software security. 
    - Nowaday, in model driven engineering ,there are a lot of tools could generate meaning and precise flow charts
    - the paper emphasize buttom up processs, and critize the top down prcocess. I think the top dwon process has its advantages
4. Summarize your presentation: can you identify one direction you would take future work in this area?
    - strategy design pattern
    - documentation
    - the

\maketitle
This is the proposal of the family of greedy algorithms to my drasil case study.

\section{Problem Description}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, 
    what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once?
\end{itemize}

\section{Goal Statements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item General: Find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once.
    \item Mathematical Definition: In the weighted graph, find the shorest path which contains all vertices.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item V and E are finite sets.
    \item It is undirected graphs, means f(e) = uv = vu.
    \item It is a connected graph.
    \item There is no loop in the graph.
\end{itemize}

\section{Theoretical Model}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nearest Neighbor Alorithm
    \item Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm
\end{itemize}

\section{Defined In Graphic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each city is a node, and each node will has its name.
    \item A node can connect to other nodes with a line.
    \item Once two nodes connected, there will be a distance assgined on the line.
\end{itemize}

\section{General Definition}
A graph G is an ordered triple (V(G), E(G), f) consisting of a nonempty set V(G) of vertices, a set E(G) of edges, 
and an incidence function f that associates with each edge and two vertices. If e is an edge and u and v are vertices, 
u, v $\in$  V (G), such that f(e) = uv, then e is said to join u and v; the vertices u and v are called the ends of e. u 
and v are endpoints of edge e. A weighted graph is a graph with each edge e of G let there be associated a real number w(e).
\begin{itemize}
    \item G = (V(G), E(G), f, w)
    \item V(G) = {$v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$, $v_5$}
    \item E(G) = {$e_1$, $e_2$, $e_3$, $e_4$, $e_5$, $e_6$, $e_7$, $e_8$}
    \item f($e_1$) = $v_1v_2$, f($e_2$) = $v_2v_3$, f(e3) = $v_3v_3$, f(e4) = $v_3v_4$, 
    \item f(e5) = $v_2v_4$, f($e_6$) = $v_4v_5$, f($e_7$) = $v_2v_5$, f($e_8$) = $v_2v_5$
    \item w($e_1$) = $n_1$, w($e_2$) = $n_2$, w($e_3$) = $n_3$, w($e_4$) = $n_4$,
    \item w($e_5$) = $n_5$, w($e_6$) = $n_6$, w($e_7$) = $n_7$, w($e_8$) = $n_8$
\end{itemize}

\section{Supporting Data Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finite Graph: A graph is finite if both its vertex set and edge set are finite.
    \item Endpoint: if f(e) = uv, edge e has endpints of u and v. u and v $\in$  V(G).
    \item Loop: An edge with identical ends. f(e) = vu and v = u. u and v $\in$  V(G).
    \item Connected Graph: if for every u, v $\in$  V(G) there exists f(e) = uv. Otherwise G is called disconnected.
    \item Walk: A walk is a sequence W = {$v_0$, $e_1$, $v_1$, $...$, $e_k$, $v_k$}, whose terms are alternatively vertices 
    and edges such that for 1$\le$i$\le$k, the edge $e_i$ has endpoints $v_{i-1}$ and $v_i$. k is the length of W.
    \item Trail: If the edges $e_1$, $e_2$, $...$, $e_k$ of a walk are distinct.
    \item Path: a path is a walk if both of its edges $e_1$, $e_2$, $...$, $e_k$ and its vertices $v_0$, $v_1$, $...$ , $v_k$ are distinct.
    \item Closed: A u,v-walk has first vertex u and last vertex v. 
    When the first and last vertex of a walk, trail or path are the same, we say that they are closed. 
    \item The Shorest Path: a path has the smallest number of sum of its edges' weight.
    \item Weight: With each edge e of G let there be associated a real number w(e), called its weight.
\end{itemize}

\section{Instance Models}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input: G = (V(G), E(G), f, w)
    \item Output: a sequence
\end{itemize}

\section{Question}
\begin{itemize}
    \item clarify on Walk, how the sequence formed? V and G are set in the definition.
    \item remove the conditon of "returns to the origin city"
\end{itemize}
